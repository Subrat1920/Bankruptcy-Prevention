# Bankruptcy Prevention Using Machine Learning
#### ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Bankruptcy is a critical issue that can have severe economic and financial consequences for businesses. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict bankruptcy risk based on financial and operational indicators. By leveraging historical financial data, we can build a predictive model that helps organizations take proactive measures to avoid bankruptcy.

#### ðŸš€ Objectives
    - Analyze financial and operational risk factors associated with bankruptcy.
    - Clean and preprocess financial data for accurate model training.
    - Implement and compare multiple machine learning models.
    - Provide a dashboard or report to visualize predictions.
    - Offer actionable insights to businesses for bankruptcy prevention.
