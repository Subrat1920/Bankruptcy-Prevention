# Bankruptcy Prevention Using Machine Learning
#### üìå Project Overview
Bankruptcy is a critical issue that can have severe economic and financial consequences for businesses. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict bankruptcy risk based on financial and operational indicators. By leveraging historical financial data, we can build a predictive model that helps organizations take proactive measures to avoid bankruptcy.

#### üöÄ Objectives
    - Analyze financial and operational risk factors associated with bankruptcy.
    - Clean and preprocess financial data for accurate model training.
    - Implement and compare multiple machine learning models.
    - Provide a dashboard or report to visualize predictions.
    - Offer actionable insights to businesses for bankruptcy prevention.

#### üìä Dataset Description
The dataset contains financial and operational risk factors related to bankruptcy. 

- **Features:**
  - `industrial_risk`: Risk level in the industry (0-1 scale).
  - `management_risk`: Level of management risk (0-1 scale).
  - `financial_flexibility`: Financial adaptability score (0-1 scale).
  - `credibility`: Creditworthiness of the business (0-1 scale).
  - `competitiveness`: Market competitiveness (0-1 scale).
  - `operating_risk`: Operational risks associated with the business (0-1 scale).
  
- **Target Variable:**
  - `class`: Indicates whether the business is at risk of bankruptcy (`bankruptcy`) or not (`non-bankruptcy`).
